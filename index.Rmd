<!-- I decided to produce two versions of these documents. One for the R audience with all the R code and some statistical issues like checking assumptions and one for a broader audience without interest in the R details.  I use echo=longform to select which R chunks to print and asis echo=longform for conditional definition of text. Currently need to set longform=T in header of index file and choose the right output directory in _bookdown.  Need to figure out how to automatically do both. -->

```{r echo=F}
# longform = T means print everything; 
# longform=F means print just the pieces for public consumption
# in hindsight I should have used the knitr global definition for echo (for r chunks) # and "asis" (for text) 
longform <- params$longform
```


# Preface {-}

```{asis echo=longform}
::: {.infobox .caution data-latex="{caution}"}

**Note**

I have an [abbreviated version](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gonzo/covid19/_public/) of these notes with limited R code displayed. That version may be easier to follow if you want to focus on the final results rather than the detailed code.

:::
  
```

```{asis echo=!longform}
::: {.infobox .caution data-latex="{caution}"}

**Note**

I have a more [detailed version](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gonzo/covid19/_book/) of these notes with complete R code.  That version may be more appropriate if you want to follow the R code used to produce this document.

** Disclaimer:  The contents of this website are in draft form.  Changes are made daily.  At this point I am more in "content creation mode" than in careful editing, consistency checks, references, and meta-level summaries.  Also, the code is run daily and all plots and tables change accordingly. Sometimes there are peculiarities that emerge for a particular day and I wasn't able to catch them prior to uploading the new day's files (e.g., a weird plot, an outlier that leads to unreasonable parameter estimates). This will eventually stablize as the notes enter their final form.** 

This book began during the Covid-19 pandemic as a set of lecture notes to teach advanced quantitative methods and data visualization to graduate statistics in the behavioral sciences at the University of Michigan. The notes are sprinkled with code because one goal is to teach how to conduct these analyses, create visualizations and interpret results.  There are two versions of these notes: one version omits much of the R code though still retains some of the flavor of how one uses these tools and interprets the output ([abbreviated version](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gonzo/covid19/_public)) and another version includes all the R code ([detailed version](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gonzo/covid19/_book)).   If you would like to see my more general set of teaching notes from the rest of the year-long graduate statistics course for additional background, visit my [course website](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gonzo/coursenotes/).

<!-- **Note** -->

<!-- Throughout these notes I adapted existing code and examples. Where I borrowed from other people I provide appropriate citation.  I wrote these notes relatively quickly and have not double checked all the code nor have edited the text carefully. I also worked on this in small pieces so there may be inconsistencies or redundancies across pieces, which will eventually be fixed and written in more elegant flowing code. -->

<!-- Various R notes -->
<!-- You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods). -->

<!-- Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively. -->

<!-- ```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'} -->
<!-- par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) -->
<!-- plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab). -->

<!-- ```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::kable( -->
<!--   head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!', -->
<!--   booktabs = TRUE -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015]. -->
